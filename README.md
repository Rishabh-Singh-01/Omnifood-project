# Omnifood Project

Omnifood is an AI-powered food subscription that will make you eat healthy again, 365 days per year. It's tailored to your personal tastes and nutritional needs.

This imaginary service source code uses HTML5 and CSS3 to create beautifully designed responsive webpage, which also includes modern flexbox & CSS grid with a little bit of garnishing of vanilla JS on top.

Please Note:
It's an imaginary service provider made by yours truly specifically for a portfolio project and practising HTML5 and CSS3, taking a very direct reference/guidance from Mr. Jonas Schmedtmann's course "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS".
